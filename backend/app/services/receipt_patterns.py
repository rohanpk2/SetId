"""
Shared regex patterns for detecting summary/label lines on receipts.

These are fuzzy on purpose — they need to tolerate OCR misspellings like
`SUBTOAL` (missing t), `TOTL`, split words (`SUB TOTAL`), hyphens
(`SUB-TOTAL`), and stylistic variants (`GRAND TOTAL`, `BALANCE DUE`).

Every regex here is used in at least two places:
  - `receipt_preparser.py` routes matching rows into the subtotal/tax/total
    fields instead of treating them as line items.
  - `receipt_parser_service.py` applies them as a defensive filter after the
    LLM cleanup step so any label that slipped through is still dropped.

Adding a new label: add the regex here once and both layers pick it up.
